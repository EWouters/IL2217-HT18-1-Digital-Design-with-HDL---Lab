# IL2217 HT18-1 Digital Design with HDL

##Lab 1

The goal of this laboration is to familiarize the students with describing combinational circuits in VHDL and to learn how to handle the simulator. The goal is also to be able to interpret outputs from a simulator and to understand how VHDL code is interpreted by the simulator.

##Lab 2

This laboration deals with Sequential Logic and the VHDL modelling of databuses. This introduces Modelling of Flip-flops and registers, and the issue of drivers for digital buses. Two new VHDL constructs: PACKAGE and RESOLUTION FUNCTION are introduced.
